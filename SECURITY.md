# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Due to the major rehaul of the new Kainda v7.0.0, the only major version currently mantained is Kainda v7. This exclusion will probably not be a problem due to the fact that prior to this version, kainda was only used in private projects and all of these are updated to newer versions.
It is important to note that due to the nature of this project old versions may be discontinued rapidly if there are major changes affecting the generated structure of a new project

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Vulnerabilities that can affect user experience using the framework must be disclosed privately first. Kainda is a free open source project made by only one person.
It is adapted to the needs of this person and his team in a business environment, so every vulnerability could affect the stability of these aforementioned businesses and may threat the jobs of dozens.

So, given context, the best to disclose security issues is by emailing kainda@jlsg.es
